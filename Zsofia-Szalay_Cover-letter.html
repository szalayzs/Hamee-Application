    <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>  
    <div style="text-align: justify">
            <p>I am an e-commerce project coordinator located in Japan, looking for new opportunities. The information I have found on Hamee is more than appealing and hereby I would like to submit my application, hoping that I can contribute to Hamee's success.</p>
            <p>The reason why I have moved to Japan, is to immerse in this beautiful culture and to improve my Japanese language skills. However, now I hold a working holiday visa with which I am eligible to work until Nov. 2019 I intend to stay in Japan longer.</p>
            <p>I currently help out at a local hostel's reception in the evenings to improve my Japanese skills, I started Google's Academy while I have more free time and I work for my previous company, OANDER part-time. At OANDER, we develop web stores on Magento 1 and 2 (PHP) platforms, helping SME-s and large companies to sell and market their goods and services proficiently online. OANDER has developed many integrations with 3rd party service providers, like payment services and ERPs. During the 2 years I have worked there, from manual tester I became a support project manager and marketing content coordinator. Besides project and content management I have helped project initailization from the platform's admin configuration side. Succesful but challenging stepstones in my career at the company included webstores going alive, or moving to new host server providers. I hold a Master's degree in Economics, Marketing and I hope to continue growing at this field in the eCommerce industry.</p>
            <p>I believe I am good at working as a part of a team and I always take responsibility for my actions and decisions. I have stayed and worked in Japan for a half-year and this experience has confirmed that I can get along with a great variety of people with different cultural and social background. I am conceived as a hard-working person and I always try to be flexible and never let down my team, but I value work-life balance. I have been recently advised by a senior to not to say that I am a fast learner (with 10 years of work experience behind my back) but I do think of being a fast learner as a value; nothing else is constant but change itself, and to change you need to adapt which often cannot be done without learning new tools, software, way of thinking or new methodology. </p>
            <span>That is why I am interested in working at a different segment of eCommerce.</span>
            <p>I would like to grow more both professionally and personally at Hameé. I find it very inspiring what growth you have realized in the past few years and how innovative Hameé's team is. I hope I will have a chance to meet in person to prove my dedication and answer the questions regarding my experience or Japanese skills.</p>
            <p>I am looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
            <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
